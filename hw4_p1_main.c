// Fall 2025 - HW4 - Problem 1
// This application uses buttons and LEDs
// The operation is such that if you press the left button, as long as you keep
// the button pressed, the LED is on. As soon as you release the button, LED is
// off and stays off until the button is pressed again. This example uses
// memory-mapped registers to communicate with GPIO peripherals. This example
// doesn't use any Driverlib function. However, it does build a Hardware
// Abstraction Layer (HAL). The main function is easy to read, but the HAL
// functions themselves are hard to write since we do not use Driverlib.

// According to the schematics on page 37 of the Launchpad user guide,
// Right button (button 2, S2) is connected to pin 4 (bit4)

//#define LL1 (1 << 0)
